        <h3>What are sakura?</h3>
        <p>The arrival of spring is marked with sakura, the Japanese word for cherry blossoms, in Japan. These flowers usually start to bloom from the end of March to mid April all across the country. They can also be found in other countries, such as China, Korea, India, Canada, and the United States. Many varieties exist and their colors range from white to pink.</p>
        <h3>Why do Japanese celebrate cherry blossoms?</h3>
        <p>Cherry blossoms are considered to be the national flower of Japan. They are also seen by the Japanese as a metaphor for the ephemeral and volatile nature of life since their blooming season is temperamental, lasting only for a few weeks. Because of their beauty and smell, they are often depicted in Japanese art, film, music and are used in all manner of consumer goods, including food. Nowadays, the Japanese admire and appreciate cherry blossom seasoning with hanami and festivals.</p>
        <h3>What is hanami?</h3>
        <p>Hanami means flower viewing and is a centuries-old practice of picnicking under a blooming sakura tree. It is believed to have started during the Nara Period with flower-viewing parties held at the imperial court in Kyoto. It was believed during this time that the cherry blossom trees contained spirits, so in order to ensure a good spring season, the parties were held as a  chance to make offerings to these spirits. Today, people enjoy eating and drinking in parks under the trees with friends and family.</p>
        <h3>What do people usually eat/drink for hanami?</h3>
        <p>You can eat and drink whatever you like for hanami! Most commonly, you will find the Japanese eating rice balls, grilled or fried meat, miso soup, salad, or bento, which are premade boxed lunches you can purchase at stores. Seasonal snacks like sakura mochi (cherry blossom flavored sticky rice) and other pink colored foods are popular choices too. For drinks, sake (rice wine) is the traditional hanami drink. Not everyone drinks alcohol however, so teas and soda are enjoyed as well!</p>
        <h3>How else do people celebrate?</h3>
        <p>Besides hanami, it is common for festivals to be held in parks. These festivals often have parades, performances, games, craft activities, biking, and more!</p>
        <h3>Where and when will this year's local Cherry Blossom Festival be held?</h3>
        <p>This year's festival is being held at Hana Park from March 18 - March 31st. The park is opened to the public 24/7, however the festivals operating hours will be 6 am - 12 am daily.</p>
