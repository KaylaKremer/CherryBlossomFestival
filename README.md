# :cherry_blossom: Cherry Blossom Festival :cherry_blossom:
This is a mockup website I made for a fake cherry blossom festival event. I created it for practice to test out using [Bootstrap 4](https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/) and jQuery plugins, including [Animsition](http://git.blivesta.com/animsition/) and [Slick](https://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/). 

I used [Now](https://zeit.co/now) to deploy my website, which can be viewed at [https://cherryblossomfestival.now.sh/](https://cherryblossomfestival.now.sh/).
